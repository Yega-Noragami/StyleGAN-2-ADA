# StyleGAN-2-ADA

### ABOUT
Abstract: Training generative adversarial networks (GAN) using too little data typically leads to discriminator overfitting, causing training to diverge. We propose an adaptive discriminator augmentation mechanism that significantly stabilizes training in limited data regimes. The approach does not require changes to loss functions or network architectures, and is applicable both when training from scratch and when fine-tuning an existing GAN on another dataset. 


## Idea Behind

This project was done as a research into how GAN's work. I decieded to mix it up by using Van Gogh's images as training data to produce fake Van Gogh's images. Note: the results shown below is from 2 days of training on Google Collab, With increase training time you might be able to obtain better results. My purpose for this repository has been served.
